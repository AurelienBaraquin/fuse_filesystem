# fuse_filesystem
*This is my first time using fuse and create a full filesystem in local, I'm doing this to understand the concept of filesystem and improve my competences about it to create a network filesystem then.*

## What is fuse?
FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is a simple interface for userspace programs to export a virtual filesystem to the Linux kernel. It also aims to provide a secure method for non privileged users to create and mount their own filesystem implementations.

## What is a filesystem?
A filesystem is a way to organize data in a storage device, it's a way to store, retrieve and update data in a storage device.

## What is a virtual filesystem?
A virtual filesystem is a filesystem that doesn't exist in a storage device, it's a way to organize data in a storage device but it's not a real filesystem, it's a way to organize data in a storage device using a software.



# My objectives in this repo :
- [x] Full binary tree filesystem
- [x] Create / Delete / Read / Write   files / directories
- [x] Add unique fonctionnalities like an auto git add or a auto make
- [x] Add a way to keep data after reboot



## Final objectives :
- [x] Create a network filesystem with client/server
- [x] Encrypt data
- [x] Add a compression system
- [x] Add a way to store data in a database
